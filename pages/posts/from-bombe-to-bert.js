      <h1>From Bombe to BERT</h1>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> June 2025</p>

        Turing’s vision of a “universal machine” laid the groundwork for how we think about computation today. 
        But what if he had seen BERT? Or GPT? Would he recognize the recursive nature of attention, or the 
        elegance of transformer-based design? In this post, I explore how the philosophy of early computing meets 
        the architecture of today’s large-scale models.
